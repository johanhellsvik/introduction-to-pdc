\frametitle{History of PDC}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item In 1988, envisioning that massive parallelism will become important for CS 
%and HPC, a group of scientists from KTH School of Computer Science and 
%Engineering applied for grant to buy a parallel computer
%\item Market was surveyed and it was decided that Thinking Machines
%Corporation (TMC) offered the best choice with its Connection Machine system, CM2
%\item What was to be called the Center for Parallel Computers was formed and 
%inaugurated by Janne Carlsson, the President of KTH, on January 15, 1990
%\item In January 1991 PDC applied for an upgrade of the CM2 to a CM200. The
%application was successful and the upgrade was installed in December 1991
%\end{itemize}
